  "Ported 1:1 from `kami-autodrive`'s `tests/multi_agent.rs`.

  Multi-agent autonomy: several agents share a world, each sensing the
  others as obstacles. Priority/index right-of-way decides who yields.

  Honest scope: this is decentralised yielding, not cooperative negotiation.
  It handles a moving crossing and a stopped/parked agent. The hard case —
  two agents head-on in the same lane — still needs active lane discipline /
  negotiation and is out of scope here."
