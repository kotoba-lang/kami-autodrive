  "Ported 1:1 from `kami-autodrive`'s `tests/hetero_fleet.rs`.

  Heterogeneous fleet: a car (bicycle), a drone (multirotor), and a ship
  (hydrodynamic) share one world and reach their goals without colliding —
  each a different plant, all driven by the same autopilot and coordinated
  by the fleet's priority right-of-way."
