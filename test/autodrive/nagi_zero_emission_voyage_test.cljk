  "Ported 1:1 from `kami-autodrive`'s `tests/nagi_zero_emission_voyage.rs`.

  funadaiku — regression test for the Nagi autonomous zero-emission voyage
  (ADR-2606013400). Two independent claims:

  1. the kami-autodrive ship GNC (autopilot + ship-hydro) actually reaches a
     goal — the autonomy substrate funadaiku reuses (ADR-2606010600);
  2. the zero-emission powertrain dispatch books energy across wind-assist +
     solar + hydrogen with zero fossil and hydrogen as the prime mover."
